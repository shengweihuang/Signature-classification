The interpretation and management of streamed data has become an important area of research for the computer science, database, and statistics communities. Signature as data transform maps multi-dimensional paths to the sequence of their iterated integrals.
We treat signatures as features in this method. Then, we use the binary classifier to distinguish different time intervals. This is the first step towards the signature trading strategies.
